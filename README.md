# Rice Grain Counting using Contour and Watershed Algorithm

This project aims to develop a program that can accurately predict the number of rice grains in an image. This program uses the contour and watershed algorithm to segment the rice grains in the image and count the number of rice grains present in it.

## Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib

## Results
The program will display the original image, the segmented image, and the final result with the number of rice grains counted.
